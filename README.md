# rob514_cameraproject

See the Wiki for documentation for both the Object ID and Camera projects.

Running find_radius.m should take an image from the Pictures file and find the radius of the inflated actuator. (Object ID project)

Running fitsphere.m should take two images from the Pictures file (/Nikon) and reconstruct a sphere. It creates a point cloud (ptCloudRaw.ply) of the actuator and its surroundings. (Camera project) 

fitellipse.m takes the saved point cloud and attempts to fit an ellipse to it. It works some of the time. (Camera project)

ptCloudSegmentation.m attempts several methods of reducing noise in the point cloud data to fit the ellipse. (Camera project)

## Folders

"Pictures" holds the raw images. 

"Process" holds the iterations of images generated by running the code. 

"Figures" holds the output images, including estimated radii, for the four input images. 

"CameraCalibration" holds the calibration images for the two cameras being used as well as the MatLab code that provides the camera properties.

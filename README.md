See the Wiki for documentation. 

Running find_radius.m should take an image from the Pictures file and find the radius of the inflated actuator. 

## Folders

"Pictures" holds the raw images. 

"Process" holds the iterations of images generated by running the code. 

"Figures" holds the output images, including estimated radii, for the four input images. 

"CameraCalibration" holds the calibration images for the two cameras being used as well as the MatLab code that provides the camera properties.
